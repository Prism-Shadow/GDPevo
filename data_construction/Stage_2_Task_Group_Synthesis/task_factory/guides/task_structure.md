# Task Structure

## Input

Each construction run reads one scenario. The scenario should contain several examples, and each example should contain:

- `example_id`
- `source`
- `prompt`
- `notes`
- `attachments`

These examples define task complexity, business context, data types, and long-horizon work intensity. The task group must not simply copy the examples; it should abstract transferable scenario experience and SOPs from them.

## Output Directory

`task_factory/task_group/<task_group_id>/` should contain:

A completed task group should contain exactly 5 train tasks and 5 test tasks.

## Field Requirements

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task_group.task_group_id` | Yes | Globally unique task group identifier; the directory name must match this field |
| `task_group.scenario_id` | Yes | Source scenario ID |
| `task_group.source_examples` | Yes | Stage 1 example IDs used to construct the task group; all must come from the same scenario |
| `task_group.domain` | Yes | Domain label |
| `task_group.description` | Yes | Shared task-group background; not default solver input |
| `env.setup` | Yes | Environment setup entry point |
| `env.files` | Yes | Shared environment files declared in the final task group index; must include `env/endpoints.txt` |
| `train_tasks` | Yes | Exactly 5 train task entries: `train_001` through `train_005` |
| `test_tasks` | Yes | Exactly 5 test task entries: `test_001` through `test_005` |

`env/endpoints.txt` is a plain endpoint inventory. List every reachable endpoint
once as `METHOD /path`, including business endpoints, `/health`, and
`/api/judge`. Do not include descriptions, examples, host names, credentials,
or usage instructions.

Each item under `train_tasks` and `test_tasks` is a formal task:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task_id` | Yes | Task identifier unique within the task group; use `train_001` or `test_001` |
| `input` | Yes | Solver input directory |
| `prompt_txt` | Yes | Solver-visible task request |
| `payloads` | Yes | List of solver-visible payload files; must include `input/payloads/answer_template.json` |
| `notes` | Yes | Hidden bilingual notes file in English and Chinese; use `<task>/notes/notes.md` |
| `output` | Yes | Standard-answer directory |
| `answer_json` | Yes | Standard-answer file |
| `eval.script` | Yes | Evaluation entry script |
| `eval.files` | Yes | Evaluation-related files |
| `eval.rubric` | Yes | 6-10 scoring points spanning at least 3 independently fail-able business aspects; each item uses `goal` and `weight`; each `weight` can only be `1`, `2`, or `3`, and its maximum contribution is `weight / sum(weight)`; evaluators may award deterministic partial fractions within a point |

## answer_template.json

Every train and test task must provide:

```text
input/payloads/answer_template.json
```

This file is solver-visible and specifies the exact expected output format. It should include:

- Required top-level keys and nested keys.
- Field types, such as number, integer, boolean, enum, list, object, or string.
- Numeric precision and units for scored numeric values.
- Allowed enum values for classifications, statuses, actions, tags, or other choice fields.
- List ordering rules, stable identifiers, and required object keys.

`answer_template.json` should remove output-schema uncertainty without revealing answers, scoring weights, hidden notes, SOPs, or evidence shortcuts.
